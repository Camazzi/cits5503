## Report Assignment

### Due Sunday 4th October 23:59 AWST

#### Project Brief

You are a consultant who has been asked to write a report for a rapidly growing pet food company (PFC), based in Perth who would like to upgrade their systems to cope with the increasing global demand for their products. The company has rented space in a data centre for their systems that are a mix of Windows and Linux Servers, networking and firewall equipment and a range of storage devices (SANs, NAS, disk drives in servers). The company uses a range of software that they have purchased over the years that run on these machines. The functionality covered is everything from finance, sales and manufacturing to online product sales through their website.

PFC have received venture capital funding and want to expand into new markets, especially Asia and China in particular. To do this, they will need to be able to use modern systems that scale and operate at global scale. 

Your report is being written for the board but also have enough detail about overall architectures so that the technical and operational teams are able to understand the direction the company will be taking. 

Remember, technology serves the business not the other way around.

Also, you are aware that there will be future requirements such as data analysis and AI that will be critical for the success of the company and so your proposals should factor in the ability to use data in this way.

Finally, you are driven by the principles of privacy and security by design. Factor that approach into what you recommend and discuss.

The report should be between 3,000 - 5,000 words and include the following sections:

[1] The move to the cloud. The pros and cons of moving infrastructure from being on-premises to cloud based. Consider this in the context of global expansion and resilience. Although you are an expert in AWS, you are not limited to recommending an AWS approach. You could suggest using Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud or a mixture. Remember the countries that you want to operate in, includes China, how would you serve that market? What would be the issues of a hybrid approach and how could your architecture accommodate this (answer this in [2]) 

[2] The overall architectural approach. There are in-house systems as well as the potential to move to SAAS solutions. Should you recommend straight VMs, containers or some other approach such as Lambda. If you provided an Application Programming Interface into your systems, suppliers and vendors could potentially integrate into your systems to simplify supply chain and distribution channels.

[3] Scaling. On the consumer side, your website sees an ever-expanding demand, in part from the surge in the number of pets that people are keeping and also the move to online purchasing. Discuss the different ways in which scaling could be achieved (auto-scaling, load balancing, etc).

[4] Your choice. Add a section that covers functionality from DevOps, IAM or AI. Go through how these technologies could be applied and used at PFC

### Warnings!

Please do not quote text from AWS or other vendor web pages. Put everything into your own words and stick to a factual writing style. This is not an exercise in marketing. Please do not copy paste diagrams either. Of course, do not copy other people's work and if you reference a research paper or website, use a citation.

### Marking Rubric

The overall assignment is worth 40%. The report will be marked out of 100. Marks will be split evenly between each of the 4 sections, i.e. 25 marks for each section.

For each section, marks will be allocated as follows:

1. Text uses good English and grammar. It is understandable and reads well (5 marks)
2. Good coverage and logic of the main points to underpin the argument being made (10 marks)
3. Factually correct explanations of the technologies and principles being used (5 marks)
4. Clear evidence of independent research of material, products, services (5 marks)

Bonus marks of up to 5% can be earned for anything showing research of material outside of content provided in lectures or labs.
